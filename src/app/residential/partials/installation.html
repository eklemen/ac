			<h3>The Air Conditioning Installation Process</h3>
			<p>The process of installing the air conditioner you have selected for your home starts with ensuring your existing system is properly removed and that any necessary components in your home have been taken out or upgraded. It is important that you spend time choosing a system that matches your specific cooling needs but also that you upgrade any necessary components in your home that might offer better efficiency ratings and ensure the system will work properly for years to come.</p>
