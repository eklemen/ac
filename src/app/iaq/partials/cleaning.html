							    	Electronic Air Cleaners
							    </v-pane-header>

							    <v-pane-content>
							      Electronic air cleaners are not filters. Instead, they create an electric field that ionizes and traps particles that pass through it. Using an external power source to run, these air cleaners cleanse the air that flows through your HVAC system—drastically improving your indoor air quality.

							      Electrostatic Filters
							    </v-pane-header>

							    <v-pane-content>
							      <p>Using static electricity, electrostatic air filters efficiently clean the air inside your home—permanently. An electrostatic charge is generated by air flowing through a maze of static-prone fibers, attracting airborne particles like a magnet and removing them from the air you breathe. Better still, electrostatic air filters are washable air filters, which means that you don’t need to replace them.</p>
							      <p>Advantages to installing an electrostatic air filter:</p>
							      <ul>
							      	<li>No harmful ozone emissions</li>
							      	<li>Reduces pollen, dust and airborne pollutants</li>
							      	<li>Less house cleaning</li>
							      	<li>Never needs replacing</li>
							      	<li>High dust and particle holding capacity</li>
							      </ul>

							      UV Lights
							    </v-pane-header>

							    <v-pane-content>
							    	<p>While conventional air filters and cleaners reduce the amount of larger particles that infiltrate your ductwork, ultraviolet (UV) light helps to rid your indoor air environment of smaller contaminants and microorganisms, like mold, bacteria and viruses.</p>
							    	<p>Combined with a high-efficiency air filter, a UV light can be installed to literally 'wash' the air. Here's how:</p>
							    	<ul>
							    		<li>It destroys bacteria and viruses</li>
							    		<li>It reduces smelly odors, including those caused by chemical VOCs (volatile organic compounds)</li>
							    		<li>It eliminates common air pollutants</li>
							    	</ul>
