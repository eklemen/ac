			<h2>Maintenence Contracts</h2>
			<p>Your air conditioner and heater needs routine maintenance to check for potential problems and to operate at its peak efficiency just like any other type of mechanical equipment. If left unchecked, a small problem can lead to an expensive repair and potentially shorten the equipment life as well as unnecessarily increasing your utility costs, so it is important to identify and repair any potential issues sooner rather than later.</p>

			<p>We recommend checking the equipment twice per year, once in the spring before the cooling season and once in fall before the heating system to keep your energy costs to a minimum, extend the life of your equipment and ensure year round trouble–free comfort in your home.</p>
